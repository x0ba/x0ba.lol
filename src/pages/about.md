Hi! I'm Daniel, a high school student in San Francisco, California.

In the future, I'm looking to pursue a degree in computer science or engineering.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I like to mess around with code, listen to music, ride around on my bike, make music, and read. I also dabble in photography and writing.

I also maintain several packages in the [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) repo, and maintain my own package repository at [github:x0ba/nur](https://github.com/x0ba/nur).

## Experience

I'm familiar with the following programming languages

- Java
- Python
- Kotlin
- Lua
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Nix

And the following tooling

- Kubernetes
- Docker
- Nix Flakes
