<p style="text-align: center;">
I'm a high school student based in San Francisco, California. I do some dev work in my spare time, mostly with <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a> and web development.
I also <a href = "https://github.com/x0ba">make a bunch of stuff</a>
You can find me on Mastodon as <a href = "https://social.lol/@dax">dax@social.lol</a> or other platforms as `x0ba`.
